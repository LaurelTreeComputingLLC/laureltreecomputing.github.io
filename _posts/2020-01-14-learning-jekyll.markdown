As I continue to pursue my new adventure in software development, I keep stumbling upon many other nuances of the job that keep my attention from the actual coding.  For instance, blogging on this site. 

I have ended up using Jekyll and github pages as stated before but there is a small learning curve to Jekyll to get your posts up on the site, published, and polished.  While I've never been able to make my web pages as suave and asthetically pleasing, I imagine it takes time to fully understand the software I'm using so that I can progress in this arena.

# Markup and more

With Jekyll using the Markup Language, which is a slimmed down UML/XML/HTML type language to present and tag information inside a text file, I've looked around for some helpful hints, shortcuts, cheatsheets, directions, and so forth.

## A list of references
- [Jekyll Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/jekyll) - cheatsheet of markup and Jekyll
- [Jekyll Compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) for command-line shortcuts
- More to come!
